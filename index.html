		I’m thinking about cats again<br>
		And again, and again and again and again.<br>
		I think about how many don’t have a home<br>

		I think about how cute they are<br>
		And how their ears and the whiskers and the nose.

	<p>
		I just love them.<br>

		And I want them in a basket.<br>
		And I want little bow ties.<br>
		I just love them.<br>
		And I want them<br>

			<h1>Stalking cat</h1>
		</a>
		<p>
			This cat is like a horror movie, but it's not horrible
			(which is where the word 'horror' comes from) because it's
			just a cat. You've probably seen this, it's totally famous.
			I hope this cat is single.

			<h1>Cat gets up, walks away</h1>
		</a>
		<p>
			So, there's this cat, and he's (or she's, if it's not a he)
			lying down, then he (or she, if it's not a he) suddenly
			thinks "That's enough of lying down", so he (or she, if it's
			not a he) gets up and totally walks away. Funny thing is
			he (or she if it's not a he) walks on two legs, and cats
			normally walk on four, whether they're a he or a she!

			<h1>Cat plays keyboard like they usually wouldn't</h1>
		</a>
		<p>
			People tell me this cat (or she if it's not a he) is dead.
			This is <strong>not true</strong> as cats are immortal
			right until the end of their lives. I like this video even
			though I can't play the keyboard. LOL!

			<h1>Goat wears mask, scares other goats</h1>
		</a>
		<p>
			Goats have a lot in common with cats (eg legs) but if you
			look closely they are quite different. For example, goat's
			cheese is quite nice whereas cat's cheese made me sick and
			was difficult to make.

			<h1>Cat gets angry and stands up</h1>
		</a>
		<p>
			This cat shows us we should stand up to others,
			even if it looks weird. This cat should win
			the nobel peace prize for fighting.
